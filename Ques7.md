QUES7.  The equations of two lines of regression, obtained in a correlation analysis
between variables X and Y are as follows:

and . 2X + 3 − 8 = 0 2Y + X − 5 = 0 The variance of X = 4 Find the
a. Variance of Y
b. Coefficient of determination of C and Y
c. Standard error of estimate of X on Y and of Y on X.


_Ans_ 
a. Variance of Y:
The equation of the line of regression for Y is 2Y + X - 5 = 0
Y = (-1/2)X + 5/2
Variance of Y = (Variance of X) * (Coefficient of X)^2
= 4 * (-1/2)^2
= 4 * 1/4
= 1

b. r = √(Coefficient of X * Coefficient of Y)
     = √(2 * 1/2) 
     = √1 
     = 1


c.estimating X based on Y
The standard error of estimate of X on Y is the square root of the mean squared error 
In this case, since the line of regression passes through the point (5/2, 0), the variance of the residuals is 0.
Standard error of estimate of X on Y = √(Variance of residuals) = √0 = 0
