Q-1. A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its
applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT
scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the
correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?
_ANS_
correlation coefficient ranges between -1 to 1 more towards 1 is more correlated while more towards -1 is weakly correlated in this scenario the corr coeff is 0.7 which means both SAT Scores and College GPA are highly correlated if one entity increases another will also inc and vice versa
