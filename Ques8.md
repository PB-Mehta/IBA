Q-8. The anxiety levels of 10 participants were measured before and after a new therapy.
The scores are not normally distributed. Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test whether
the therapy had a significant effect on anxiety levels. The data is given below: Participant
Before therapy After therapy Difference

_Ans_


1. Set up the null and alternative hypotheses:
   - Null hypothesis (H0): The therapy did not have a significant effect on anxiety levels.
   - Alternative hypothesis (H1): The therapy had a significant effect on anxiety levels.



Participant | Difference | Absolute Difference | Rank
------------|-------------|---------------------|-----
1           | -3          | 3                   | -4
2           | -2          | 2                   | -2
3           | -2          | 2                   | -2
4           | -3          | 3                   | -4
5           | -1          | 1                   | -1
6           | -1          | 1                   | -1
7           | -2          | 2                   | -2
8           | -1          | 1                   | -1
9           | -2          | 2                   | -2
10          | -2          | 2                   | -2

3. - Sum the positive ranks: SP = 0 (no positive ranks)
   - Sum the negative ranks: SN = -18

4. Determine the critical value:
   - Since we have 10 participants, we can refer to the Wilcoxon signed-rank table to find the critical value for alpha = 0.05.
   - The critical value for a two-tailed test with n = 10 and alpha = 0.05 is 11.

5. Compare the test statistic with the critical value:
   - If the absolute value of the test statistic (W) is less than or equal to the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we reject the null hypothesis.

In this case, since W = 0 and the critical value is 11, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the therapy had a significant effect on anxiety levels based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
